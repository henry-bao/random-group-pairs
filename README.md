# Random Group Pairs

some crappy code I wrote at 1:40am to randomly pair up groups for the INFO 340 lab section that I am teaching ðŸ¥²

check out the [demo](https://henry-bao.github.io/random-group-pair/)

![a preview image of the website. From the top it says "How many groups are there", followed by a number input box and slick submit button](./img/screenshot.png)
